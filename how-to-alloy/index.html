    <p>Are you still trying to find the alloy recipe?</p><br />
    <p>Try this!</p><br />
    <p>We consider the Alloyer GUI as: </p><br />
    <p> S1 S2 S3</p><br />
    <p>               O</p><br />
    <p>    L</p><br />
    <p>When alloying, put a lava bucket in the L slot. </p><br />
    <p>Then, try copper block, tin block, iron block and nickel block in the S1 and S2 slots. </p><br />
    <p>Then, click one of the slots. You can get a bucket of melted stuff. Craft it with two blue ice! </p><br />
    <p>Recipes are: </p><br />
    <ul>
      <li>Copper block + tin block = bronze</li>
      <li>Nickel block + iron block = invar</li>
      <li>Nickel block + copper block = constantan</li>
      <li>Compressed netherite + double compressed redstone = netheredstonite</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Have a try! </p><br />
